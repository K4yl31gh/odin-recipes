    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tosilog is a popular Filipino breakfast meal. The name tosilog was derived from the different components of the meal which are: Tocino (cured pork), Sinangag (Filipino garlic fried rice), and Sunny-side up egg. Tosilog is best eaten with a spicy vinegar dip.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tocino</li>
        <li>Sinaggag</li>
        <li>Sunny-side up eggs</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the water in a cooking pot</li>
        <li>Once the water starts to boil, pour-in the cooking oil and add the uncooked tocino. Boil in medium heat until the water evaporates</li>
        <li>Once the water completely evaporate, the oil will be left behind. Let one side of the tocino cook in oil for 3 minutes. Flip the tocino and cook the other side for the same time</li>
        <li>Arrange the cooked tocino with the eggs in individual plates</li>
        <li>Remove the excess oil in the cooking pot where the tocino was cooked. Heat the same pot and put-in the sinangag. Cook the fried rice for 1 minute while tossing. The residue from the tocino will stick to the fried rice making it more tasty</li>
        <li>Arrange the fried rice with the tocino in individual plates</li>
        <li>Serve hot. Share and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
