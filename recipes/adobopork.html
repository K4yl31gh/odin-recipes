    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand.</p>
    <p>Be prepared to do some marinating, but if you are in a rush, you have to do it for just 1 hour. After that, you can start working on your stew! We just need to combine our ingredients, and let them simmer for some time. Making adobo really is not as difficult as it may seem!</p>
